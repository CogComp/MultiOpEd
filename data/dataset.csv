"Is It Right To Tear Down Statues Some See As Problematic?
","Removing them is sheer fanaticism
",0,"Removing the statues is sheer fanaticism
","The current effort to remove monuments from America's history has become too extreme, believes John Daniel Davidson of The Federalist. This movement has gone beyond just removing statues of racist historical figures, it has become an ideological purity test.  When statues of Christopher Columbus are torn down and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is defaced, something has gone too far. These protesters are attacking US history. They see America as something that needs to be torn down. Columbus helped establish this country, which has embodied democracy and freedom. Denying this is political extremism of the worst kind.

","Confederate monuments represent the very worst of American history and should be removed, writes the Dallas Morning News in an editorial. There is no debate; these men fought to keep human beings in bondage to uphold slavery. Statues celebrating these men and what they fought for have no place in America. At a time when the country is reckoning with its history and systemic racism, we should remove these stains on our conscience. They should be replaced with American heroes we can all look up to, like Sgt. Roy Benavidez. We need to let our country heal from its racist past to help turn the page towards a better future.

",0,"We must reform, not defund the police
","Defunding the police is not the answer to America's complicated policing problem, holds Robert Verbruggen of National Review. Lowering the police's capabilities will result in an increase in crime that nobody wants. We need to improve their training with a focus on de-escalation. Additionally, we need to reform the current system that lets bad cops off the hook far too easily. If not, they will lose their legitimacy, and further incidents of malpractice will erode public trust and invite more protests. Policies like qualified immunity need to be revised as they often protect police officers that break the law. A well-funded, well-trained, transparent and accountable police force is the way forward.

","It is time to have a serious talk about defunding the police, believes Christy E. Lopez of The Washington Post. This doesn't mean abolishing it; nobody wants that and police continue to serve an important role in society. However, reforming the police is no longer enough. The core issue is that Americans have become far too reliant on cops to solve everyday issues. Defunding the police means giving some of their funding to mental health and violence interruption programs instead. Community mediation that seeks to help individuals first is essential. The police can be part of this future, but its current presence in everyday American life must be reduced.

","President Trump demanding a tougher reaction to the George Floyd protests risks worsening the situation, suggests Frida Ghitis of CNN. At a time when the country needs a leader who calls for unity and calms tempers, he is creating further antagonism and division. It appears that he is doing so to rally his political base and cement his image as a tough ""law and order"" leader to help his reelection chances. This only sows division and partisanship. It throws fuel on the fire, making many communities angrier when they are already suffering real pain and grief. It would've been better had Trump said nothing at all.

","President Trump is right to call for better policing in the wake of protests, holds Rich Lowry of National Review. It is the absence of police that encourages looting and destruction. By having officers on-site to keep rioters in check, much damage can be avoided. So far, we have seen a strong lack of leadership among local governors, who have refrained from using more law enforcement in fear of seeming too oppressive. It was this thinking that led to the torching of a Minneapolis police station. If protesters aren't checked, they might very well commit more violence and damage more property. Law and order are needed.

","Voter fraud due to mail-in voting is a serious issue, holds John Fund of National Review. Sending ballots to each individual American opens up the door to others interfering with this process. ""Ballot harvesting"" could occur, where someone collects the ballots of others, fills them out and hands them in. In California, mail-in voting is happening in a flawed way. Los Angeles County has a registration rate of 112% of its adult population. This way, many ballots are sent to people that moved or are deceased. During the 2016 election, millions of ballots were misdirected. Democrats appear to be trying to use mail-in ballots to benefit themselves politically."

","President Trump's claim that mail-in ballots lead to voter fraud is incorrect, reports Chris Cillizza of CNN. The widespread election fraud he described is nonexistent in the US. This has been proven by multiple studies, even one commissioned by George W. Bush. In the 2016 election, which Trump claimed was marred by voter fraud, only four instances of it were ever found. The president seems to be preparing this voter fraud excuse in case he ends up losing to Joe Biden. He reportedly routinely and falsely accuses opponents of cheating, whether that be in the 2016 election, which he won, or in the 2016 Iowa caucus, which he lost to Ted Cruz."

The Russiagate investigation that Obama started was based on opposition research by Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Department of Justice withheld key information while warrants were enforced erroneously. Members of the Obama administration sought to reveal Trump allies under investigation several times. The power of the White House was used to find damaging information about people close to Trump. While Obama himself is likely innocent, several incidents point to foul play in the Russiagate investigation.

Around 99.9% of infected people recover. Of those who have died, 90% had pre-existing conditions. While the lockdown may prevent some infections, once it ends that may have been for nothing. People who aren't getting infected now might just get infected later. Countries that had harsh lockdowns might see new waves emerge as traveling resumes. The economic downturn resulting from maintaining the lockdown is going to cause great damage to health; we must end it."

",0,It's too dangerous to end the lockdown,"The current lockdown should stay in place until the COVID-19 situation gets better, argues Brian Resnick of Vox. The vast majority of Americans have yet to be infected and develop immunity. Ending quarantine measures could allow the virus to spread rapidly. We need to conduct more testing, contact tracing and isolate infected people more effectively. States just aren't doing enough testing to accurately analyze the spread and handle new outbreaks. For now, staying in isolation is the best solution. The number of infected is finally reaching its peak; we still need to continue lockdown measures to ensure that the virus's spread is curtailed."

Meanwhile, Tara Reade, Biden's accuser, indicated that she was timing her accusation to hurt him as much as possible in an old tweet. Her story also changed over the years. Neither of these points means she's clearly lying, however. Still, dropping Biden would take a lot more evidence than what has been presented so far.

Cuomo is the first New York governor in almost 100 years that didn't raise taxes on the rich during a crisis. He did this even though higher taxes on the rich are favored by even 87% of New York's Republicans. Cuomo also ignored calls to improve public housing and protect tenants that can't pay rent. The media is sadly ignoring Cuomo's flawed decisions."

Trump must face the consequences of his own failures in handling this crisis and stop trying to shift the blame. This animosity could worsen the trade dispute between the US and China and inflame a new Cold War.

China's refusal to be transparent, especially in the early stages of the outbreak, prevented measures that could have slowed the spread of the coronavirus. Citizens in Wuhan were initially punished for ""spreading rumors"" about COVID-19. The Shanghai laboratory, which published the disease's genome was shut down. The truth about the danger of the virus was withheld for as long as possible. Trump is right to point out these failures. His critics need to recognize the problems with China's COVID-19 response."

It would be wrong to focus solely on the economy or political implications; health is paramount here.

In fact, Soleimani had a leading hand in the killing of at least 500 US service members in Iraq. Iran is leading a longstanding underground campaign against US forces, the latest example being the recent attack on the US embassy in Iraq. Soleimani himself was involved in arming militants in Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Gaza, all of which were fighting US or US-allied forces. With him gone, Iran's aggressive terror capacities have been seriously limited."

Baltimore is a prime example of a city that has been run terribly, for which Cummings, who has held elected office for four decades, bears some responsibility. Among the 30 largest US cities, it has the highest crime rate. No other place equals its more than 50 homicides for 100,000 people, which rivals of Venezuela and El Salvador. Bernie Sanders made very similar comments to Trump in 2015. Still, the president is being lambasted for stating a generally agreed-upon truth."

","President Donald Trump's blasting of Baltimore and its mayor, Elijah Cummings, was tinted in racist ideals, asserts Goldie Taylor of The Daily Beast. He has shown no aversion to using bigoted language, having told minority US Congresswomen to ""go back"" to places other than America, among other controversial statements. His criticism was born from identity politics against black Americans. Singling out this city and its people comes as no surprise from a president who has made many racist statements. Baltimore has problems, but they are born from racism, such as that of the Jim Crow era. Pointing the finger, and not acknowledging the city's systemic difficulties ignores the full picture.

This saga has highlighted the bias of the media that tried to smear the president.

This could make her very appealing to much of the electorate. From middle-aged moderates to millennial liberals, Harris could unite Democrats like few others.

While it appears that the woman in the song is being pestered by the man, they actually appear to be on good terms. Her saying “no” as he pesters her is representative of an era where women weren’t allowed to say “yes.” These words indicate a fear of what others would think if she just said “yes.” This is an accurate portrayal of a society where women were expected to cage their sexuality and remain ""pure."" She goes along with it, putting up enough resistance to say “she tried” before doing what she really wants to.

The now former U.S. Attorney General rightly put the sanctity of his office above loyalty to Trump, which is why he was fired. The president has appointed a more loyal man in his stead, who will do everything possible to choke the Russia probe.

","Brett Kavanaugh’s erratic temperament makes him unfit for the Supreme Court, writes Adam Liptak of The New York Times. The American Bar Association has lowered the rating it initially gave him after his aggressive outbursts during his hearing. This situation also brought up concerns from 2006 that he was too unbalanced to be on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Several lawyers and judges said that his decision-making is not adequate for a judge. Already at the time, Republicans ignored these concerns and did their best to get Kavanaugh confirmed. The Republicans also discounted the Bar Association's revised evaluation of him, calling the Association a liberal interest group."

","It is unfair to use Brett Kavanaugh’s temperament to undermine his Supreme Court appointment, holds Noah Feldman of Bloomberg. The Court has a history of irritable and partisan members that nonetheless helped craft excellent judicial law. In the early 20th century, justices like Hugo Black or Robert Jackson were highly moody, opinionated and nakedly partisan. The case against Kavanaugh being built on his emotional outbursts is not a strong one. Bickering, undermining each other and voicing strongly political opinions have all taken place on the Supreme Court. One justice was even a KKK member. Having strong opinions doesn't make Kavanaugh a worse judge."

","The estate tax brings in minimal government funds while being a huge drain on family businesses, reports Antony Davies of The Washington Examiner. When a business owner dies and his or her property is taxed, the heirs may need to sell assets to cover this cost. In the case of a company whose value is made up of machinery, buildings and land instead of money, there is a strong risk that it will lose key parts of its operation. Assets like these are usually worth more to the business than they are on the market, so the compensation is generally not enough. To avoid this fate, many business owners channel their funds elsewhere, stunting their company’s growth, just to avoid the estate tax.

","Donald Trump is complicit in the damage that hurricanes cause because of the way he denies and exacerbates climate change through his policies, holds the editorial board of The Washington Post. Science has pointed out clear links between Hurricane Harvey’s destructiveness and climate change caused by humans. Only this week did Trump announce plans to relax regulations on methane emissions. A greenhouse gas, it is highly damaging to the environment. His policies have systematically ignored the growing danger of climate change and the disasters it causes. Hurricane Florence only happens because people like him continue to act this way.

The hurricane is set to affect millions of Americans and cause tragic losses. Finding ways to pin responsibility on the president before any of this happens is a cheap tactic. The argument the Post made is part of a larger campaign to undermine Trump. Blaming a single hurricane on one person twists science to fit political agendas.

","While the U.S. economy is growing, many middle-class workers earn incredibly low salaries that keep them in poverty, reports Matthew Desmond of The New York Times. The term “working homeless” describes a group of people that have jobs but cannot afford a home due to high housing costs. American productivity has gone up 77% since 1973, but wages have only risen by 12%. Today, many people can find jobs but not ones that help them afford even basic necessities. The dismantling of unions has contributed to this. America has become incredibly wealthy over past decades, but most of this wealth is channeled to the already rich."

","Having a job is pivotal in helping poor people lift themselves up, argues Ron Haskins of The Brooking Institute. There is a direct correlation between a household’s employment levels and their poverty. Not only do jobs increase social mobility, they also provide meaning and happiness. An Urban Institute study found that single mothers specifically who stopped receiving welfare and entered the labor force saw drastic reductions in their poverty levels. The decline in working rates in America has strongly contributed to more people living in poverty. Job training programs are some of many ways we should support jobless people in finding employment.

Additionally, it is very natural for caricatures to exaggerate a person’s features. Condemning Mark Knight's depiction opens the door to all caricatures of black people being off-limits. Criticism about the depiction of her opponent, Naomi Osaka, who is Haitian-Japanese, misses that her skin tone is almost as dark as Williams’. Accusations of racism go too far.

","The military parade that President Trump has asked for would be a big waste of resources, writes Paul Waldman of The Washington Post. Having seen its estimated cost rise to $92 million instead of the originally foreseen $12 million, the parade is not worth it. The main reason Trump wants it is to flatter his ego, to make him seem like a strong leader. The US, the strongest nation in human history, has no need to show off its power. The parade would also divert troops from their necessary job of protecting the country. Even within the military, few support such an idea. Republicans are making a mistake by supporting it and catering to Trump’s ego."

Trump’s own real estate company was sued the government in the '70s for refusing to rent to black tenants, which he defended. His actions indicate a bigoted view of black people."

","Mission Impossible: Fallout is a gem that lives up to its predecessors and impresses in almost every aspect, holds A. A. Dowd of the AV Club. Suspenseful, exciting, full of gravity-defying action and with a plot that intrigues, it’s an all-round great movie. Tom Cruise rolls back the years with a fantastic performance, completing some mind-boggling stunts on the way. Beneath the perfectly executed action of the film sits a plot that is mystifying and deep, playing with betrayal and morality. With just the right sprinkle of comic relief, provided by Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, it’s the perfect ambassador for the spy-thriller genre.

","Mission Impossible: Fallout is an overload of action and adrenaline that drowns out everything else in a very one-dimensional way, suggests Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture. With dialogue that follows many cliches and an unimpressive plot, the movie offers very little beyond its admittedly breathtaking action scenes. Overly dramatic and with far too intense pacing, it suffers in most other areas. The story isn’t special and Tom Cruise’s ‘action man’ character has a rather limited personality. Without a compelling narrative, it’s hard to put much importance on the death-defying scenes that seem to fill every minute of the film.

","While Facebook’s stock price crashed down almost 19% due to setbacks in user growth and profits, the company is set to do well over the long-term, infers Aimee Picchi of CBS News. This downturn was the result of new EU data laws and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, Facebook’s stock decline only reached levels of May 2017, and will likely bounce back, as it has done during previous controversies. In fact, the EU data laws will probably benefit the company as it makes it harder for smaller companies with fewer resources to fully comply.

","Brett Kavanaugh is a good choice for the Supreme Court and has been demonized unfairly by some, suggests Ruben Navarrette Jr. of the San Francisco Chronicle. He has shown the character and solid ideals that this position requires. His strong family values, professional reputation as both an educator and past public servant are all positive traits. Especially his humility stands out as a much-needed quality in the Supreme Court. Democrats have unfairly targeted Kavanaugh for partisan reasons, ignoring the fact that he is well-suited for this position.

While it can’t yet be fully proven that he is conspiring with Moscow, much of his behavior indicates that it is so. The way he dismissed US intelligence agencies while siding with Vladimir Putin was a slap to America and a huge victory for the Russian leader.

Clinton will not likely take on the role of party unifier, as she did not have full party support in the last election. Additionally, her candidacy would most likely be welcomed more by the Republican party than by her fellow Democrats, a large portion of which preferred Bernie Sanders over her.

One year ago, he tried to block a young undocumented woman in U.S. custody from accessing a legal abortion, even after she had cleared legal challenges in Texas. His willingness to use his power to try to block this woman’s right to a legal abortion suggests he'll try to do the same for women nationwide. He has also ruled against women’s access to birth control, believing that bosses have the right to deny employees birth control coverage based on their own personal beliefs.

","Civil asset forfeitures are necessary for police to effectively fight crime, write Brian McVeigh and Dave Sutton for USA Today. There are many regulations that ensure that only the property of criminals is seized. Judges oversee these cases to ensure everything is done by the book. The tactic exists to counter drug dealers exchanging their drugs for cash or other things. Seizing these assets, which must be linked to illegal activity first, prevent further crimes from being committed. Taking the cash that a dealer needs to buy more drugs is a good thing. Stopping this practice would hamper the good police work needed to fight the drug trade.

","The big failure of Westworld’s second season was that it failed to bring its viewers back to earth after working hard to keep them confused and questioning what was really going on, suggests Erik Kain of Forbes. Season 1 was full of mystifying events, but it managed to wrap everything up in a way that was highly satisfying and, most importantly, made all of the confusion worth it. With season two, it is questionable if that’s the case too. While still highly enjoyable to watch, it couldn’t quite capture the great subtlety of its predecessor. Similarly, its message about free will seems a little heavy-handed. Perhaps a second season wasn’t needed."

Additionally, Trump seemed to offer this huge concession without getting anything concrete in return. Reducing US military presence on the Korean peninsula could give North Korea dominance over the region, which also benefits its main ally, China. Trump’s words have already worried strategic partners. The joint exercises should continue.

","To pursue peace, the US should consider ending its joint military exercises on the Korean peninsula, asserts John Merrill of Nikkei Asian Review. These drills continue to instill in North Korea's regime the idea that it is under an existential threat, which makes it hold on to nuclear weapons even tighter. It is important to remember that America destroyed many North Korean cities when the two countries went to war. Agreeing to mutual concessions in terms of military actions is the best way to lessen these tensions and work towards real peace. Past strategies, such as ignoring or isolating the regime haven’t worked. Lessening military maneuvers is a good strategy.

","The movie Ocean’s 8 tries to continue the great quality of its franchise but fails to do so, believes Colin Covert of the Star Tribune. Its failure isn’t because of the all-female cast, the actresses are let down by a poor plot. Characters such as Sandra Bullock’s Debbie Ocean aren’t very relatable. Her personality isn’t explored in detail, robbing her of much-needed depth. Most of the cast is too cool and distant, making it hard for the audience to really feel for them. The story is bland and feels rehashed, failing to capture previous titles’ tongue-in-cheek wit and drama. With little excitement or unique qualities, Ocean’s 8 shows why reboots are so risky."

The gay couple that requested a cake for their marriage was not denied service based on their sexuality; he would have provided them any other service that wasn’t explicitly part of something that went against his beliefs. Phillips’ marriage ideals are legitimate and should not be squashed to appease others. The Supreme Court was right to uphold his rights in this case.

People that eat such food regularly have a twelve percent higher chance of getting the disease. Many meals with high levels of sugar and sodium stand out. Processed meats, cookies, dehydrated soups and sauces are other culprits. The recent increase of such foods in people’s diets has caused a rise in various cancers and other diseases.

The regulations also put them at an unfair disadvantage; they can’t afford the teams of lawyers that banking giants have, to navigate each detail.

They also get retiree health coverage, which isn’t given in the private sector. Supply and demand is crucial. As there are many graduates in teaching-related topics, schools have a large pool of workers to choose from. This naturally lowers their salaries. Teachers aren’t underpaid.

","President Trump’s effort to roll back fuel efficiency regulations would be damaging to the environment and raise costs on American drivers through higher fuel consumption, infers Paul Bledsoe of The New York Times. According to one estimate, this decision could increase fuel costs by $193 billion to $236 billion by 2035. These would fall mostly on US citizens. Fuel efficiency standards started in 1975 and by 2015 had saved Americans $3.8 billion at the gas pump. Trump is wrong to implement these changes as they will increase costs for few tangible benefits. California and others will enforce the current standard either way, even if the rules are revoked."

","Fuel efficiency rules were unrealistic to begin with and are rightly being dismantled, believes James Taylor of the Orlando Sentinel. While more miles per gallon is a nice goal to work towards, the kinds of cars that reach these performances are expensive. The average American shouldn’t have to pay higher prices for a car that some say has to be more fuel efficient. The original fuel-economy restrictions were borne out of an oil embargo with Arab countries. This is no longer the case. A more effective way of fighting emissions would be to export more natural gas, which is cleaner than coal, to places like India and China, thus benefiting the US economy.

Alone, both T-Mobile and particularly Sprint, which has lots of debt, would have difficulty creating the infrastructure needed to succeed with 5G technology. Critics of the merger ignore that second-tier companies joining to become a first-tier one gives them the ability to better compete. Together, they could seriously challenge Verizon's and At&T's market dominance."

","Robert Mueller’s questions, which have been published, are phrased in a way that could put President Trump in hot water when he answers them, asserts Norman Eisen of Politico. In essence, if Trump answers truthfully he might admit that he knew about his campaign’s links to Russia, which could look very bad for him. Alternatively, if he lies about these events, he risks incriminating himself just as well. Even if Trump were to plead the Fifth Amendment, the right not to incriminate oneself, this would strongly indicate that he has something to hide. In combination with the evidence Mueller will present, a strong case could be made against Trump.

","It is still far too early to be talking about Donald Trump earning a Nobel Peace Prize, writes Fred Kaplan of Slate. If anything, his visible hunger for it will give North Korea more leverage in negotiations. No binding peace accord has been signed so far. The assumption that a meaningful truce will be agreed upon after one set of talks is overly ambitious. Furthermore, Trump’s rhetoric is unlikely to have changed the situation. Even after he threatened North Korea with “fire and fury,” it fired a ballistic missile over Japan. Kim Jong-un likely changed his rhetoric once his nuclear power was established.

Despite previously denouncing the Iran deal, agreeing with Trump to pull out of the Paris climate accord and asserting that Russian interference did not impact the 2016 presidential election, he currently pledged to support a diplomatic resolution of the nuclear deal if it fails and vowed to push for global recognition of LGBTQ rights.

","Despite a restrained Senate confirmation hearing, Mike Pompeo’s political record shows that he is far from being diplomatic or a champion of human rights and tolerance, and therefore should not be nominated as US Secretary of State, argues Human Rights Watch Washington Director Sarah Margon in USA Today. Aside from advocating mass surveillance practices that could infringe on personal privacy rights, Pompeo has promoted bigotry, supported the CIA’s use of torture, equated gay sex with perversion, and advocated legislation restricting women’s reproductive rights. The latter particularly goes against the State Department's agenda of advancing gender equality and women’s rights abroad. The Secretary of State should embrace universal human, health and reproductive rights and dispel bigotry. Mike Pompeo has shown that he does not.

","With his trade tariffs on China President Trump has chosen an adversary that he cannot beat, holds Philippe Legrain of Foreign Policy. While both countries have much to lose from a potential trade war, China has the means persevere economically and politically. Thirty-seven percent of its exports are essential to American manufacturers. Much of the technology that China sends over is simply assembled there but originates from places like South Korea and Japan. Furthermore, while many US industries rely on imports from China, it can simply buy elsewhere. Soybean farmers and airplane builders are set to suffer from tariffs.

For example, not buying American debt would result in its own currency getting stronger in ways that would hamper its exports. A potential trade war could benefit the US, because it would reduce its national deficit due to importing more than it exports. Even if China were to block imports on soybean companies or Apple, this would not severely affect America’s GDP. The US holds all the aces because of its economic supremacy.

Trump’s lawyer, Andrew Cohen, has a wide playing field for the ways he may advise the president, going beyond just providing legal advice. This also covers settling cases with payments to possible litigants. Judges often give the FBI more leeway than is respectful of suspects’ rights.

","The conservative movement that Bill Buckley championed with grace, wit and stoicism has been warped into something more extreme, divisive and potentially less successful under President Trump, according to Richard Brookhiser of National Review. Buckley would routinely engage those who opposed him in constructive dialogue. In his rise to power, Trump ravaged the G.O.P, diminishing Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio among others. He has created a personality cult around himself, not the party, surrounding himself with weak personalities to make himself seem stronger.

Two big factors united conservatives in energetic partisanship: the lack of a clear outside enemy, once presented by Communism and the Soviet Union, and a lack of strong leadership. Without a uniting mission and cause, opposition to the left became the easiest solution. Intellectual conservatives were cast aside for a simpler agenda that thrived through finger-pointing. Trump is a symptom of this movement, not its pioneer.

The best way to combat the terrible violence committed by deranged gunmen is to look at our communities and how we can monitor them better. Similar to the terrible crimes of men like Harvey Weinstein or Larry Nassar, enablers that look the other way allowed things to get as bad as they did. Almost every mass shooter has given off many warning signs that something was wrong. People need to be vigilant and aware of those around them. If society acknowledges and listens to these warning signs, we could reduce these atrocities.

Similarly, increasing background checks for buying guns to cover more types of purchases is also widely supported.

","The budget resolution of the Republican-held Congress will balloon America’s deficit and flies in the face of conservative and limited government ideals, argues Republican Senator Mike Lee in The Daily Signal.

","The Nunes Memo is the clearest indicator that the FBI and Justice Department went about their work in a partisan way, motivated to hurt Trump politically, believes Chris Buskirk of American Greatness. FBI agents hid the Steele Dossier’s limitations when trying to justify their investigation into the Trump campaign. The whole Russia collusion story has been exaggerated and is based on faulty evidence. All of this strongly indicates some form of conspiracy to topple Trump. Law enforcement agents acted well outside of their boundaries to twist the truth about Russia’s involvement. This reflects extremely poorly on the FBI.

Denying that this would be the case and then still using a projection of him felt half-baked. The show did little to be extraordinary. In fact, even referencing Prince just highlighted how much better his Super Bowl show was than Timberlake’s. The nice dance choreographies ripped the focus away from the good music.

While jihadist cells still exist in the shadows, the Islamic State’s army has been defeated. The international coalition, led by a highly effective US air campaign, thoroughly squashed the group. Tens of thousands of its fighters are now dead. This news seems to have gone under the radar, but it is certainly a cause for celebration."

The caliphate that long profited from smuggling goods also has more legitimate dealings. Corrupt politicians and businessmen allow ISIS to invest through third parties and grow its wealth. Until the caliphate’s financial capabilities are neutralized, it will always remain a threat."

It is highly likely that this method will solve the issues we currently face. Spurring people to work for Medicaid has several upsides.

","The #MeToo campaign has turned a positive movement of fighting sexual harassment into a witch hunt based only loosely on facts that seek to limit the playfulness that makes flirting fun and enticing, suggests Daphne Merkin in The New York Times. The way that people communicate sexual interest in each other can take many forms. When a man makes advances on a woman, the initial engagement tends to happen without clear consent. Flirtatious exchanges can include some degree of acceptable forcefulness. The lines get blurry; #MeToo should understand this and abstain from seeing harassment where there is none.

The notion that sex and flirting rely on a certain suspension of consent is deeply erroneous. It is not unsexy to ensure that a potential sexual partner is fully on board before pursuing them. Critics of #MeToo may refer to a type of sex that happens without many words, which some might deem more appealing, but the thrill of intercourse isn’t killed by establishing consent. #MeToo certainly has its flaws; judgment should directly relate to the severity of a crime. However, flirting and sex don’t rely on borderline sexual harassment to be fun.

","Walmart presented its recent decision to offer better salaries to its employees as a product of President Trump’s tax cuts, but that is not actually the case, believes Pat Garofalo of US News. The rise in wages was a natural development that had been preceded by other raises, and likely came, at least in part, as a response to Target, a competitor, raising its own wage bill. Due to low unemployment, these companies need to raise wages to retain staff and offer a better service. Walmart is one of many companies that used raises as a means to gain favor from Trump, by attributing them to his tax reform, when he really had little to do with it.

Several Republicans are retiring from their positions because they predict that they’d lose anyway. President Trump has pushed the party to the fringes, reducing the ability of individual Republicans to get things done, as compromises have been shunned. Furthermore, sitting presidents have historically done poorly during the midterms with an approval rating of less than 50%, averaging a loss of 50 seats. Trump’s approval rating sits at 37%, and Democrats need 24 seats to flip the House. 2018 is not likely to be kind to Republicans."

Any support from the US government may do more harm than good at this point, argues Philip Gordon in the New York Times, especially as it is not yet known what the protest movement is really about or where it will lead. Many in the Trump administration argue that the only way for true change in Iran is through regime change, which is more likely to happen if mass protests don't have public support from Washington.

","Despite boasting that the new tax plan will repeal Obamacare, President Trump is incorrect. Though part of the bill repeals the individual mandate, most of Obamacare actually remains in place, clarifies Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine. Medicaid expansion to cover the poor remains intact, as do subsidies for individuals to buy insurance and regulations to keep insurers from accepting only the healthy and excluding the sick. While repealing the individual mandate may make marketplaces less effective and make premiums more expensive, states that want to have a highly functioning marketplace will be able to impose a state-level mandate.

","Clearly not all men are bad people. However, the recent sexual assaults by powerful men highlight the way that toxic masculinity manifests itself in terrible misdeeds, asserts Sally Kohn of CNN. Our society has glamorized and glorified men that dominate women and other men. From being dismissive to downright sexually abusive, such behavior is often seen as a symbol of strength that is not just natural but even sexy. However, it is damaging. Toxic masculinity also dismisses the pain of boys and men, telling them they can’t cry or show emotion. We need to get rid of the attitudes that make abusive behavior desirable.

","While the recent wave of sexual abuses by men is disgusting and horrifying, the problem is not masculinity, believes Ned Ryun of American Greatness. It has been the push over the second half of the 20th century, away from traditional values, that has created the likes of Louis CK and Harvey Weinstein. Honor, loyalty to one’s spouse, and respecting women have all been degraded over the years. The commodification of sex and objectification of women in film and pornography has twisted the male view of women. Society should teach its boys traditional values of honorable masculinity in order to tackle these profound issues."

","President Trump’s saber-rattling on Twitter and repeated deviations from decades of US foreign policy strategy may have increased regional tensions in certain areas, but this is far from his most damaging act, writes Uri Friedman in The Atlantic. The large number of deaths the Trump regime has already caused happened thanks to the surge of US bombing campaigns that he led. In his fight against terror, the president has significantly increased the rate of civilians killed, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq. He has refused to learn from his predecessors’ mistakes that precise strategies, not just more bombs, are needed. Trump’s foreign policy is inadequate.

While some carbonated drinks may contain low levels of acidity, it is usually soft drinks, rather than sparkling water. However, when choosing what fizzy water to drink, it is best to choose brands that avoid additives.

","The current wave of gun violence in the U.S. is, in part, due to the negligence and ideological rigidness of Republicans, holds Paul Waldman of The Washington Post. They have consistently expressed their shock at mass shootings only to fall shamefully short when it came to making a difference. Only recently did the U.S. president sign a law that would make it easier for people with mental health issues to acquire guns. When a bipartisan initiative was made to stop the spread of bump stocks, this too was buried by the GOP.

Even when the Democrats ruled Congress, they were unable to muster enough votes to ban assault weapons. The fact of the matter is that a small but significant portion of voters is religiously dedicated to preserving gun rights, while the vast majority of voters consider guns a secondary issue. As the latter group chooses politicians by other categories, going against guns can swing elections. To simply blame the GOP is wrong.

This would have made more federal funding available for treatment programs, first responders, and addiction recovery assistance. The category of public health emergency only allows health commissioners to redirect money toward the opioid pandemic from other programs, which already have limited funds. Trump’s approach is too little too late.

President Trump and his Republican party are seizing upon this revelation in an effort to focus on the political motivations behind the report’s unverified yet damaging findings. But highlighting the political origins of a report, which served as a basis for the FBI to gain FISA warrants to spy on Trump campaign officials, isn’t out of the ordinary. In the past, opposition research has also led to congressional investigations.

Its presence is what makes them just as addictive as cigarettes. E-cigarettes have been found to cause lung diseases and be a direct cause of high blood pressure. They are often used to get off of cigarette addiction, but should not be thought of as healthy or non-addictive.

","Tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy have been shown to have a minimal effect on job creation or economic growth, asserts Marcus Ryu in The New York Times. In essence, they bolster a company’s post-tax revenue, giving more money to its shareholders. Lower taxes do not push companies to employ more workers, just like higher ones don’t prevent them from hiring them. Tax cuts contribute to income inequality, which is in no one’s interest, not even that of the rich. Tax cuts have contributed to polarizing American society and created huge political tension. Lowering the corporate tax rate gives money to the people that need it least.

","A lower corporate tax rate incentivizes the kind of growth that benefits the economy and encourages job creation, infers Ike Brannon of Forbes. Letting companies hold onto more of their profits gives them more cash flow to pay workers better as well as creating new positions to hire more people. This way, lowering the corporate tax rate has a direct impact on employment rates. By one estimate, workers shoulder between 45% to 75% of the corporate tax rate through layoffs or lower wages. When companies pay more taxes, their employees are the first to feel the effect of it. It is better for the country to tax corporations less so they can create more jobs."

","The current U.S. political state-mapping system is strongly stacked against Democratic voters due to gerrymandering by Republicans, which must be changed, writes Eric H. Holder Jr. in the Chicago Tribune. States like Wisconsin are set up in a way that makes certain votes more valuable than others. What this results in is Republicans getting more representatives even though the total amount of votes leans against them. It is highly necessary to re-evaluate the way that voter blocks are currently divided up in order to ensure that democracy is upheld. Unfortunately, Republicans are fighting to maintain the status quo that strongly benefits them.

","Democratic lawmakers appealing to the Supreme Court to label Wisconsin’s legislative map unconstitutional is an attempt to help themselves politically while undermining Republican votes, holds Matt Walter of Real Clear Politics. The fact of the matter is that the state’s Democratic voters cluster in cities like Milwaukee and Madison while Republican voters are spread across the rest of the state. This makes them perform better in the majority of the state’s voting districts. What it comes down to is the U.S. having a system that benefits the winner. Democrats are just trying to give themselves a political advantage, not following rules or precedent.

","While the act of prayer itself may be positive, doing so after national tragedies without making any actual effort to change things is hypocritical and insincere, especially when it comes from politicians, believes Kirsten Powers of the Washington Post. Particularly after recent tragedies, politicians and others have too easily offered thoughts and prayers instead of taking action. Too many people have followed suit, seemingly to avoid changing anything in their lives. Real improvement is needed to stop terrible things from happening, which needs to be enacted from the personal to the policy-making level. Prayer is a force for good, but it’s not always enough.

This can be a big motivator for real improvements being made. People that pray develop empathy for those that suffer and create a clear image in their minds, which can help them change things for the better. Additionally, much of the criticism directed at those who pray stems from the difference of belief in God. Beyond whether or not God exists, those in need feel more supported when they know they are prayed for. Thoughts and prayers help victims as well as the concerned.

","Donald Trump’s recent speech at the United Nations in which he threatened to destroy North Korea and called the country’s leader “rocket man” demonstrates irresponsible leadership. His name-calling and bullying approach to North Korea shows that he is foolishly miscalculating the confrontation and fails to understand the potential ramifications his arrogance could unleash, asserts Ann McFeatters in Newsday.  While both Kim Jong Un and Trump have each displayed questionable behavior toward one another on the world stage, one would expect that the U.S. president would act more maturely than North Korea’s self-indulgent despot, especially in this increasingly tense situation.

Trump has a successful campaign history of using catchy nicknames to belittle opponents and win prestige and power. His latest tactics against Kim Jong Un are to skillfully and responsibly use marketing, in which Trump excels, to ridicule the North Korean leader until he falls from grace and, ultimately, from power – with no greater damage done.

","Despite repeated rounds of fresh sanctions that the United Nations keeps imposing on North Korea, the country has not shown any signs of halting its nuclear ambitions. There are many reasons why economic sanctions are not working - and will not ever reign in North Korea's leader, argues Alexandra Ma of Business Insider. For starters, since the country has been under various sanctions for many years, the regime has been forced to create and use unconventional channels and methods. Therefore, North Korea's government has become savvy in finding ways to acquiring needed goods; when one supply is cut off, it knows how to get it from somewhere else. Also, for a country used to harsh conditions the threat of shortages doesn't intimidate. North Korea's weaknesses boost its resilience, leaving sanctions ineffective.

Despite President Trump's recent warning to destroy North Korea if the country threatened the U.S. or its allies, multinational efforts against Kim Jong-un's government, specifically pressure by China and Russia, will persuade the regime to change its provocative course. According to U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood, China is key in persuading Kim Jong-un to heed the harshest sanctions placed on any nation in the 21st century.  This is because China controls more than 90% of North Korea's external trade, including its oil supplies. Given such international cooperation to enforce the sanctions, they will work, with time."

","After a toddler, who was seated along the first base line at Yankee Stadium, was struck in the face by Todd Frazier's 105-mph-line drive, the MLB needs to mandate protective netting in all of its stadiums to protect its fans. Instead of focusing on how to speed up the game, the league should instead focus on safety precautions, argues Gabriel Baumgaertner of Sports Illustrated. This is considering that the number of fans, including children, who have been injured by foul balls is in the thousands. While arguments against netting have claimed that the league did not want to curb fans' unparalleled access to the game, the number of injuries, especially to little children, should merit mandatory protective netting before a fan gets killed."

The companies themselves, the police, hackers and others could gain access to these facial scans, which could be used to drain bank accounts, for example. Besides being less effective than fingerprint scans, such technology also requires the camera to be on at all times, gathering even more data. Apple’s gamble could end up strongly backfiring.

At the moment, food stamps help feed 41 million poor Americans, three quarters of which are children, senior citizens or disabled.

Food insecurity has been linked to more hospital visits, low blood sugar and even weaker test scores in school. USDA data indicates that every dollar spent on food stamps generates around 1.8 dollars for the economy. Cutting this essential program would hurt America."

President Trump’s suggestions for reform would reduce costs and encourage poor Americans to find jobs and lift themselves up. Validating their dependence on the state is good for neither. Giving them help with job training and searching for employment would make the poor more independent. The U.S. is wasting huge potential talent by considering welfare a permanent solution.

Calling North Korea’s bluff and signaling to China that such aggressive behavior will no longer be tolerated is producing results.

","The GOP and President Trump’s latest proposal for tax reform would hurt the majority of Americans with higher taxes to give cuts to the rich, holds Chris Weigant of the Huffington Post. In a recent Missouri speech, Trump got the crowd excited about his tax ideas even though the speech lacked some crucial details. He is likely to try to reduce the taxes that affect him and his businesses. Simply lowering taxes for America’s best earners risks creating a significant budget deficit. Trump seems to be a firm believer in trickle-down economics, a model that has consistently benefited rich entities and hurt the middle class.

The U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world, which, if reduced, would boost the country’s businesses. Additionally, the GOP wants to remove a law that taxes profits brought in from other countries, which is unique to the U.S. This would encourage companies to bring back money to invest on U.S. soil. Any deficits to the budget will be balanced out by increased corporate productivity.

","Climate change is almost certainly a large contributor to the intensity and destructiveness of Hurricane Harvey, claims Eric Holthaus of Politico. Some scientists estimate that around 30% of the hurricane’s rainfall can be attributed to climate change caused by human activity. The warming of the atmosphere creates more evaporation and increases the amount of water rainstorms carry. The Gulf of Mexico’s unusual warmth added to Harvey’s magnitude. Climate change is highly likely to have increased the hurricane’s destructive power. Society needs to come together to prevent disasters like this from happening again."

In fact, Trump’s first year of traveling is predicted to cost taxpayers more than Obama did during his whole eight years in Washington. This is somewhat strange coming from a president who, on the campaign trail, said that he wouldn’t “be a president who goes on vacation.” Trump’s excessive time off reflects his deep hypocrisy."

","A newly leaked draft report by scientists from 13 U.S. federal government agencies asserts that Americans are currently experiencing the effects of climate change. This conclusion is in direct contradiction with claims by President Trump and members of his administration. They are not convinced that humans play a role in causing global warming, claiming instead, that climate change is uncertain and that there is limited ability to predict its effects. This attitude, plus Trump’s previous decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Pact, have scientists afraid that his administration may suppress or change the report before it is formally released, writes the San Francisco Chronicle Editorial Board. The fact that the confidential report was leaked to the press before official White House approval shows that scientists are worried that Trump may suppress their definitive findings."

However, federal climate program leaders and a number of report contributors don’t expect any intereference from president. In fact, a website to feature the report is already in the works.

","The 10-page memo that former Google software engineer James Damore wrote arguing against gender diversity in the workplace is sexist. The memo, which takes aim at Google’s diversity and inclusion initiatives, asserts that the lack of women in the tech industry is directly linked to biological differences between men and women. For instance, Damore asserts that women don’t succeed as often as men in the high-pressure tech industry because of their more neurotic nature and lower tolerance for stress compared to men rather than because of other oft-cited claims of sexism. He bases these and other antiquated and stereotyped misconceptions on biological essentialism and biological determinism, two theories that have been largely discredited in today's mainstream scientific community."

Asserting that the reason behind Google’s gender gap was not due to discrimination but inherent differences in the brain influencing what men and women find interesting is a fair analysis and can be backed up by science. For example, as his memo highlights, gendered interests are predetermined by exposure to testosterone levels in the womb: higher levels are connected with a preference for mechanical interests and occupations in adulthood while lower levels are connected with a preference for people-oriented activities and occupations. This, and additional new genetic research, scientifically explain why STEM fields tend to have more men.

The new York Times focuses on the voice of real people that rely on the support of the ACA, like James Panagoulias, who who was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. He received treatment costing $300,000 but paid less than $5,000 himself thanks to the ACA’s coverage. Him and countless other Americans would see costs skyrocket without this insurance. Undoing the ACA would remove crucial healthcare that could make life-saving treatment unaffordable for those in need of it."

The threat of this happening is also likely to make Democrats willing to negotiate to prevent Obamacare’s crash without a backup plan. The president is moving forward quickly in order to achieve a much-needed success for the Republicans.

","Today's form of capitalism has spread values that make getting richer preferable to taking united action against climate change, theorizes Martin Lukacs of the Guardian. Its biggest success is shifting the focus onto individual consumers, whose pollution is tiny compared to that of large corporations. In the past 30 years one hundred companies have caused 71% of the world’s pollution. De-regulating private companies has given them the freedom to pollute excessively in their quest for maximum profits. Lobbying keeps up fuel subsidies and strongly hampers any efforts to phase out dirty energy. The current system is set up to maintain itself and its profits at the cost of the planet's environment."

In the modern day, trans and gay optimism has waned as governmental forces seek to limit their rights. Trans people in particular feel vulnerable, alone and ally-less as few stand up for them. Protest at parades is needed as much as ever to highlight oppression and to stand up for LGBT rights.

This raises worries about Republicans encouraging the limitation of liberal free speech within the media.

","The Republican outrage against a New York theatre’s rendition of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, featuring the murder a Trump-like Caesar is overblown and hypocritical, claims Jamie Peck of the Guardian. Such anger over a stage death is deeply misplaced in the context of Republican cuts to healthcare, which will result in real deaths. Furthermore, the play in fact warns against the dangers of murdering political leaders, even if one opposes them. Shakespeare’s brilliance lies in a play that reflects the politics of any era. Republicans demonstrate that freedom of expression takes a second seat when it doesn’t reflect their views.

","The current momentum of the British Labour Party’s candidate for Prime Minister, Jeremy Corbyn, has undone the advantage Prime Minister Theresa May of the Tory Party had over him, writes Maria Margaronis of The Nation. May recently pulling out of a televised debate with Corbyn suggests that she feared public opinion of her declining further, infers Margaronis. Her politics of fear and confrontation with the EU stand in stark contrast to Corbyn’s sincere appeals to the working class and interest in constructive Brexit negotiation to guarantee British jobs. His voice for social welfare that takes care of all Brits has enchanted voters.

","The White House Correspondents' Association dinner stands as a beacon of free speech and the power of journalism, infers Michael M. Grynbaum of the New York Times. He writes that particularly under a president who has derided the mainstream media, the event allowed journalists to band together in solidarity. The event highlights journalism’s role in holding the government accountable, which is needed to prop up democracy, suggests Grynbaum. The fact that comedians, in this year’s case an Indian-American Muslim host, can take digs at the country’s most powerful man demonstrates America’s commitment to freedom of speech.

","Cannabis’s medical benefits have been proven, and it needs to be legalized to support those suffering from PTSD, argues Kim Petters of Delaware Online. She explains that the drug helped her cope with her PTSD after serving in the military. Legal medication helped very little, so she turned to Cannabis, which reduced her anxiety and helped her sleep at night. However, she describes the arduous process of obtaining the drug legally, concluding that it should be legalized so that it can be used to help veterans treat their war-induced metal health issues.

Given China's agreement that the days for discussions and diplomacy with Pyongyang are over, Tillerson affirms that moving the US Navy strike group is a prudent measure to maintain readiness and presence to counter North Korea's threat in the region.

It has also been proven that female coaches are held up to different standards than their male counterparts and have less job security.

Relatedly, while more women are playing sports, they haven't ever had a female coach or mentor, so they don't identify or recognize an opportunity to become a coach.

Zhang argues that being made uncomfortable is what encourages the kind of political discourse that allows theories to clash and perspectives to grow. By cutting off speakers that it doesn't agree with the faculty robs its students of a crucial learning opportunity.

","In response to Dana Schutz's painting ""Open Casket"" on display at the Whitney Biennial, a group of artists wrote an open letter stating that Emmett Till’s gruesome death should not be used by white artists to promote themselves or their art. Josephine Livingstone and Lovia Gyarkye of New Republic assert that Schutz’s interpretation of Till's mutilated face is simply not true enough to the original photograph that his mother took to spread awareness. The painting's face is smeared, robbing it of its most pungent feature, the horror of a destroyed human face. Livingstone and Gyarkye imply that Schutz's artwork embellishes it for white audiences.

This does not look good for peace in the region as the growingly isolated communist regime becomes more belligerent. War seems less inevitable as Trump embraces calling North Korea's bluffs, which are hopefully just that.

The Switch enables users to play more effectively and comfortably by providing the the opportunity to plug the tablet into the TV at home and to use two controllers wirelessly or attached to a grip, while also providing the chance to take and play the tablet while on the go or not in front of the TV, without a need for video downloading or streaming, reports Devin Coldewey in TechCrunch.

In fact, CNBC states that an estimated two-thirds of Americans suffer from substance dependence or abuse that involves marijuana. The article also asserts that, similar to how the legalization of gambling set the stage for a rise in illegal gambling, the legalization of marijuana use will increase the number of users and make way for illegal marijuana trafficking.

","The boycott against retaliers selling Trump brands is not working.  In fact, writes Pete Evans at CBC News, politically driven boycotts tend to be misguided and ineffective because one company can end up being targeted by two opposing protest groups. More often than note, says Evans, a retail boycott just gives opponents a list of companies to support, thereby making up for the boycotters' lost sales.

","The uplifting La La Land is memorable and hype-worthy for its creative and successful homage to classic Hollywood musicals. Its romantic leads are terrific, and the movie's story is charming and unironic, writes Peter Bradshaw writes in The Guardian.  This sweet-natured movie is worthy of its accolades.

","La La Land fails to live up to its own hype, according to Nick Cannata-Bowman of CheatSheet. The movie suffers from quite a few obvious missteps. While the lead actors and cinematagraphy are solid, they don't make up for the thin story, slow pacing and shallow take on jazz. The movie is good but certainly not one of the year's best.

","According to Jake Fuentes at Medium, the protests allow the Trump administration to purposely test the limits of governmental checks and balances for the sole self-serving purpose of consolidating power. From Trump's perspective, he gets to test the system by doing what he wants, thus getting exactly what he wants. Fuentes suggests that the administration never planned to actually use the green card element of the ban.

","Protests do make a difference, as Slate's Jammel Bouie shows by looking at the recent Women's March. Its nationwide and global unity against the Trump administration flustered the new president, causing him to rush into making wrong decisions. Bouie further makes the point that now that Trump is president, it's a whole new ballgame because the backlash against him can hurt the entire GOP as mid-term elections come into focus.

","Proving her media savvy, within one day, Beyonce's pregnancy announcement on Instagram became the platform's most-liked post of all time. Andrew Flanagan at NPR shows that Beyonce knows how to channel the power of her brand for her own benefit. Using Instagram once again, as she did to announce previous projects, and as her post was part of a larger pregnancy photo shoot displayed on her website, Beyonce is using this announcement as another way to promote her image, brand and upcoming appearances.

","By deciding to announce her pregnancy on February 1st, the first day of Black History Month, Beyonce made a cultural statement. Instead of responding to President Trump's self-referential speech at his Black History address, Beyonce instead chose to use social media to share a piece of positive news, thus changing the public conversation and tone, according to Tobi Oredein of The Debrief. Oredein also says that her post was a way to show other African Americans, particularly women, that it is possible to keep control over your own narrative."

","Kim Kardashian is damaging to the feminist movement. Arguably the world's most well-known female celebrity, Kim uses her popularity to promote the message that women are no more than their physical appearance - a message feminists work hard to fight against. Chelsea Samelson writes in the New York Post that Kim's self-adulation is dangerous to the millions of young female followers who see in her that vanity and looks are all you need to succeed. It is anti-feminist to promote that power comes from appearance alone.

","Kim Kardashian is good for feminism as she is broadening its definition. Over the decades, feminism has evolved from equal opportunity for women to something more narrow, political and even radical.  Emily Zanotti writes in HeatStreet that Kim Kardashian's refusal to be labeled or pigeonholed is exactly what feminism needs today. As most of Kim's followers don't follow politics, she is serving as an ambassador to a new demographic of the women's movement, who see and support their icon's independence, entrepreneurship and busines savvy.
